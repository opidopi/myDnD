As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.","You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses."]},{"Name":"Lay on Hands","Description":["Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.","As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.","Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.","This feature has no effect on undead and constructs."]},{"Name":"Fighting Style","Description":["At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the follow ing options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.","Defense: While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.","Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.","Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.","Protection: When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield."]},{"Name":"Spellcasting","Description":["By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.","Preparing and Casting Spells: The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.","You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.","For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.","You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.","Spellcasting Ability: Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.","Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier","Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier","Spellcasting Focus: You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells."]},{"Name":"Divine Smite","Description":["Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8."]},{"Name":"Divine Health","Description":["By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease."]},{"Name":"Sacred Oath","Description":["When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.","Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.","Oath Spells: Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.","If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.","Channel Divinity: Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.","When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.","Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC."]},{"Name":"Ability Score Improvement","Description":["When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.","Conquering Presence: You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.","Guided Strike: You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses."]},{"Name":"Aura of Conquest","Description":["Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.","If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there.","At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet."]},{"Name":"Sentinel","Description":["You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy’s guard, gaining the following benefits:","When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature’s speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.","Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.","When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn’t have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.",""]}],"EquipmentList":[{"Name":"The Butcher","Description":["3-Headed Flail","","You look like a gnoll (and smell like one too)","Magic Weapon - choose 1 on hit","      - extra 2d12 Damage","      - DC 17 Con save or paralized until start of your next turn","      - DC 17 Wis save or confused until start of your next turn","","Demonic Hunger: Eat corpse ","                              1d10 hp for meduim,","                              2d10 for large,","                              4d10 for Huge","                              8d10 for Gargantuan","Resist Cold, Fire and Lightning","","Invisibility 1 per day","Move addtional half speed and extra attack when an enemy is reduced to 0 hp by your attack"]},{"Name":"Adamantine Full Plate","Description":["AC:18","Cannot be crit"]},{"Name":"Animated Sheild","Description":["Speak command word sheild floats around on own accord","+2 AC","Requires attunement"]},{"Name":"Nightvision Goggles","Description":["can see in the dark"]},{"Name":"Figurine of Power","Description":["Griffen","","Speak command word to get a griffon"]}],"AttackList":[{"Name":"The Butcher","Description":["See Equipment for Details"],"BonusAttack":1,"BonusDamage":1,"Proficient":true,"baseStat":{"AbilityModifier":0,"Name":"Strength","Type":"Core","SubType":"Physical","StatBase":16,"Value":0,"TotalModifier":0,"TempBase":{"Key":"","Value":0},"Modifiers":[]},"DamageTypes":["Magical","Bludgeoning","Proficient"],"DamageDice":[{"Key":12,"Value":1},{"Key":8,"Value":1}]}],"SpellBooks":[{"Name":"Paladin Spells","castingClass":"Paladin","castingAbility":"Charisma","attBonusMod":0,"saveBonusMod":0,"knownSpells":[{"Name":"Aid","School":"abjuration","Cantrip":false,"Ritual":false,"Level":2,"CastingTime":"1 action","Range":"30 feet","Components":"V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)","Duration":"8 hours","Description":["Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve.
